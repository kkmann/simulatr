# simulatr: Generator for Reproducible Fake Data

This repository contains the model solution of *simulatr*,
an example package for learning about software development best-practices for R packages.

First make sure that the devtools package is installed
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then run the package checks in the root directory by calling
```
devtools::check()
```
Inspect the output and fix the problems one by one.

To build the documentation locally, use
```
# install.packages("pkgdown")
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Hint: start with the file `R/f_simulate_continuous_data.R`

Remember to create a branch for each problem, commit your changes, push them,
and open a pull request from your branch on 'main'.
Keep working on your branch until the error/warning you worked on is gone,
then review and merge your pull request.
